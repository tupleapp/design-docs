# Move Guest Buttons to Popover (wip)

## Summary

Let's move the controls for switching mouse and keyboard modes into the popover.

This will:

- Get us ready to support fullscreen mode, since we'll no longer need a toolbar on the guest window.
- Give back some screen real estate to guests.
- Get all controls in the same place, which improves consistency. 
- Give us a good home for the guest's eventual resolution-changing UI element.


## Goals

- Put all frequently-used call-related controls in one place.

## Non-goals

## Proposed functionality
